## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

First, I encountered some trouble with the environment because it was a different version of Android studio, so some features were different such as finding 
code/design bar for the xml files, and also for github, recently they stopped using password authentication, and I had to learn how to connect to my repository
in github with the personal access token, also how to create a token.
Second, I really struggled keeping up with the videos, because it was new content for me and was a bit hard to digest when the video progreesed quickly. I am
still quite familiar with some functions of the program, but personally I think that it is part of the process on starting something new.
